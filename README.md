# Restaurant-menu
This is a digital restaurant menu built using HTML and CSS to replace traditional paper menus. The menu is designed to be responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing. It categorizes items like starters, main courses, desserts, and beverages with clear pricing and section separation.
## Project Description:
